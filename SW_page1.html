    <p>The first of the iconic 'Widows' was the daughter of Roger Moore,  <strong> Deborah </strong>.  She potrayed the Widow in a series of provocative(for the time) ads in the late 1980s.  In the ad,  'Looking Good' she is shown dressing for the evening and emerging in the full Widows cloak to the fanfare of the music.</p>

    <p>Deborah later appeared in the Bond movie ‘Die Another Day’ and the recent BBC series, ‘Sherlock’.</p>

    <p>Born in Portsmouth, <strong>Amanda Lamb</strong> started her working life as an estate agent before moving into modelling.</p>
    <p>In 1994, Amanda took over the role of the Widow through a period of immense change in financial services. She portrayed the living logo through a decade that included nine TV advertising campaigns for Scottish Widows.</p>
    <p>After Scottish Widows Amanda went on to present ‘A Place in the Sun’ and ‘Family Super Cooks’.</p>

    <p>In 2014 <strong>Amber Martinez</strong> was  selected to represent the living icon of Scottish Widows. Amber, 26, is from  Hertfordshire and is the Scottish Widow.</p>
    <p>Amber says "I grew up  admiring the Scottish Widow and am honoured to have the opportunity to carry on  such an iconic role."</p>
    <p>Amber is the perfect  contemporary choice to bring even greater warmth to the Scottish Widows brand.</p>
